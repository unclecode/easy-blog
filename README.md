- creat a custom hook useUserData
- Implement useAuthState that return user object
- Using useEffect on user object, get a query to user collection, and set username for it
- At this state we don't have username, so it will return UsernameForm, add SignOutButton to show the sign out
- You will see Login bcoz in Navbar we do not render it when username is not null
- U may get some errors in console, if Firestore API is not enable just follow given links
